\section{Changelog}

Clarifications of specifications (without actual changes of implementations) 
are numbered with lowercase letters, e.g. {\em V1.00a}, {\em V1.00b} etc.

\smallskip

Changes which affect the implementation of codecs are indicated by increasing
version numbers, e.g. {\em V1.00}, {\em V1.01}. Version numbering is independent
for each codec.
