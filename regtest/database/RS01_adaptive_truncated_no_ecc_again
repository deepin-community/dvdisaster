Adaptive reading: Stopping when unreadable intervals < 16.
* Warning: Using adaptive reading without error correction data
*          has little advantage over linear reading, but may
*          cause significant wear on the drive due to excessive
*          seek operations.
*          Please consider using linear reading instead.
