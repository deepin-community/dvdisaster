Data integrity:
- sectors          : 21000 in image; 1892 in ecc file
* Unrecoverable sector found!
* 
* Sector 1000 is marked unreadable in the ecc file.
* 
* The ecc file was probably taken from a medium which
* was NOT fully recovered. That means that some sectors
* in the ecc file are missing and its error correction
* capacity will be reduced.
* ... more unrecoverable sectors found ...
* further messages are suppressed unless the -v option is given.
* missing sectors  : 1000 - 1014 (in ecc file)
* BAD image/file   : 15 sectors missing
  ... data section   : 0 sectors missing; 0 CRC errors
  ... crc section    : 0 sectors missing
  ... ecc section    : 15 sectors missing
* Ecc block test   : 75 good, 15 bad; 30601 bad sub blocks
- erasure counts   :  avg =  1.0; worst = 1 per ecc block.
- prognosis        : 22892 of 22892 sectors recoverable (100.0%)
