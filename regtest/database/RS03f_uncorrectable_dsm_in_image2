Data integrity:
- sectors          : 21000 in image; 1892 in ecc file
* Unrecoverable sector found!
* 
* Sector 3030 is marked unreadable and seems to come
* from a different medium.
* 
* The image was probably mastered from defective content.
* For example it might contain one or more files which came
* from a damaged medium which was NOT fully recovered.
* This means that some files may have been silently corrupted.
* 
* The label of the original (defective) medium was:
* 
*  Random Image 2
* 
* Since the image was already created defective it can not be
* repaired by dvdisaster. Also it will not be possible to create
* error correction data for it. Sorry for the bad news.
* missing sector   : 3030 
* ... more unrecoverable sectors found ...
* further messages are suppressed unless the -v option is given.
* missing sector   : 4400 
* missing sector   : 4411 
* BAD image/file   : 3 sectors missing
  ... data section   : 3 sectors missing; 0 CRC errors
  ... crc section    : 0 sectors missing
  ... ecc section    : 0 sectors missing
* Ecc block test   : 87 good, 3 bad; 6120 bad sub blocks
- erasure counts   :  avg =  1.0; worst = 1 per ecc block.
- prognosis        : 22892 of 22892 sectors recoverable (100.0%)
