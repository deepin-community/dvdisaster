rs02-tmp.iso: present, contains 34932 medium sectors.
* Unrecoverable sector found!
* 
* Sector 30030 is marked unreadable and seems to come
* from a different medium.
* 
* The image was probably mastered from defective content.
* For example it might contain one or more files which came
* from a damaged medium which was NOT fully recovered.
* This means that some files may have been silently corrupted.
* 
* The label of the original (defective) medium was:
* 
*  Random Image 2
* 
* Since the image was already created defective it can not be
* repaired by dvdisaster. Also it will not be possible to create
* error correction data for it. Sorry for the bad news.
* ... more unrecoverable sectors found ...
* further messages are suppressed unless the -v option is given.
